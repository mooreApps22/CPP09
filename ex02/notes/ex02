Exercise 02: PmergeMe
	program must be able to use a positive integer sequence as an arguement
	program must use merge-insert sort algorithm to sort the positive integer sequence
		You need to use the Ford-Johnson algorithm (Art of Computer Programming, Vol.3. Merge Insertion, Page 184)
	display error message
	must be able to use at least 3000 different integers
	You have to use two different container not yet used

	Ex02: Deque and list
		Ford-Johnson involves splitting sequences into pairs and doing insert+mergeo(linked-lists are ideal for inserting operations)
		Deque has fast insertion at both ends and can serve as a good sequence container
